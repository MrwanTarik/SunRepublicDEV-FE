  "northenCyprus": "North Cyprus",
  "northenCyprusContentOne": "The Turkish Republic of North Cyprus is the full name of the country. It is located in the northern part of the island. It was founded in July 1974 and declared its independence in November 1984. Thus, the TRNC can be considered one of the youngest states on Earth. The territory of the republic is 3,355 square kilometers. Almost 400 thousand people live here. At the same time, about three million tourists visit the republic every year! First of all, they are attracted by the rich history, which has its roots in the Middle Ages, and mild Mediterranean climate. In summer the air temperature here ranges from 21°C to 37°C, in winter - from 5 °C to 15 °C. More than 300 days a year are sunny!",
  "northenCyprusContentTwo": "The capital of North Cyprus is Nicosia. Locals call it Lefkosha. Other major regions are Famagusta, Girne, Guzelyurt, Iskele. Due to its geographical location, Cyprus can be attributed to the countries of the Middle East, Western Asia and Europe. The southern coast of the TRNC has many kilometers of beaches, in the north - the Beshbarmak Mountains, which means Five Fingers in Turkish. The length of the massif, located parallel to the shore, is about 128 kilometers. Its highest point is 1,023 meters - Mount Selvili Tepe near Lapta.",
  "northenCyprusContentThree": "Let's tell you more about the three major cities of North Cyprus.",
  "nocosiaHeader": "Lefkosha (Nicosia)",
  "nocosiaContentOne": "Olive groves, grape plantations and citrus orchards! This is what surrounds Lefkosha, the main city of Northern Cyprus. It is located at the foot of the Beshbarmak mountains at an altitude of 170 meters above sea level. It is the only capital in the world that belongs to two states. The \"green zone\" runs right through its center - an echo of the conflict between the Greeks and Turks. It happened in the mid-70s of the last century. Then Cyprus was divided into southern and northern parts. Southerners call their capital Nicosia.",
  "nocosiaContentTwo": "The city was founded in the VII century BC and called Ledra. For almost three millennia, it has repeatedly migrated from the hands of one ruler to another. Who has not been here for many years! The troops of Alexander the Great, the army of King Richard the Lionheart of England and the soldiers of the Ottoman Empire. This explains Lefkosha's rich historical heritage. There are  Cyrenian Gate, the Selimiye Mosque, the Venetian Column, the Buyuk Khan Caravanserai and the Church of St.Nicholas. Tourists have a lot to see here.",
  "nocosiaContentThree": "Today Lefkosha is the largest city in North Cyprus. There are several universities, shopping and entertainment complexes and many restaurants. On the streets of Lefkosha you can see buildings in European, Greek and Turkish styles.",
  "KyreniaHeader": "Girne (Kyrenia)",
  "KyreniaContentOne": "This beautiful port city is located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Girne is the tourist Mecca of North Cyprus. It is almost 2.5 thousand years old. From the first days of its history it has been a tasty morsel for conquerors from different parts of the world. At one time, the Egyptian pharaohs, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Venetians, the Turks, and the British ruled here. This explains the large number of ancient stone buildings, castles and fortresses. In one of them, the Cyrenian fortress, dating from the XVI century, there are museums of shipwrecks and torture.",
  "KyreniaContentTwo": "The mountains that block Girne from the rest of the island have created a truly paradise of nature. There are many sandy beaches here, and the sea pleases the eye with its azure color. Dozens of large and small yachts moored at the pier of the Kyrenian harbor create a romantic picture of peace. Cozy cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops add it.",
  "KyreniaContentThree": "Lovers of fun will not be bored here. Concerts and festivals are held in Girne. It is also quite legal to place bets in the casino. Hundreds of hotels have been built for guests, including five-star hotels. Colleges and universities are located in the city.",
  "FamagustaHeader": "Famagusta",
  "FamagustaContentOne": "The city on the east coast of Cyprus was founded by the Egyptians in the III century BC and named Arsinoe. They were attracted by the deepest harbor of the island and the cleanest sandy beaches. The city received the name Famagusta in the XII century AD. At various times the city was conquered by the Assyrians, Persians, Romans, Venetians, Ottomans. It affected the look of the historical part of Famagusta. Here you will see the ruins of ancient fortresses, medieval churches, colorful mosques and temples.",
  "FamagustaContentTwo": "The Greeks and Turks also fought for the city. The last conflict occurred in the summer of 1974. After that, a buffer \"green zone\" appeared here. It divided the island into the Greek South and the Turkish North. It also passes through Famagusta, on the coast it ends in the Varosha area. Dozens of fashionable hotels once operated here, world-class stars bought up real estate. Now this area is called a ghost town. In August 1974 all its inhabitants left their homes within a day. For almost half a century the entrance to the territory of Varosha was closed to absolutely everyone. A small part of it was opened to tourists in the fall of 2020.",
  "FamagustaContentThree": "Famagusta attracts not only tourists. In 1979 the first university in Cyprus, the Eastern Mediterranean University, was opened in the city. Students from all over the world study there.",
